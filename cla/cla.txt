what is cla(command line arguments)
->The arguments which are passing at the time of python program execution is considered as cla
-->We can implement cla in python bying argv variable which available in sys module
--->argv variable is not array it is list type
---->indexing and slice operator are applicable
---->Usually space in seperator between command line arguments if our command line argument itself contains space then we must
enclosed with double quotes and not with single quotation
--->argv will display the output with file name
--->As we know that argv is list type but the arguments items which are present inside list is string type
if we are trying to perform addition of two numbers than it will perform string concatination to overcome this
problem we need to perform typecasting based on the requirment
